Ademre is well known for producing the powerful, capable and talented fighters known as Adem mercenaries, or Cethan. It has many schools which teach different "paths" or styles of fighting. Those who are trained, and who successfully demonstrate their prowess through tests and challenges, are allowed to "take the Red" or begin wearing the bright red tight-fitting clothing that distinguishes Adem mercenaries from others. They then are usually sent out to work as highly paid body guards and warriors for hire, sending funds back to the barren homeland which is then used to support their schools and their families.',

    description:
      'Located on The Reft, Tarbean is a fishing city that has grown into a thriving metropolitan center. It is so large many say it is impossible to walk from one end of the city to the other in a single day. More like many cities cobbled into one, it is organized into innumerable districts: Downings, Drover Court, the Wash, Middletown, Tallows, Tunning, Dockside, the Tarway, Seamline Lane, etc. For the most part, however, Tarbean is divided into two districts: Waterside and Hillside. Waterside is closest to the sea, and as such is comprised of the docks, lowly taverns, cheap shops, and low wealth residential. It is filled with beggars, thieves, criminals, and most other imaginable types who one would dread coming upon in a dark ally. This is where Kvothe spends his three years after his family is killed. Hillside is far away from the crude types that make their living from the sea, and is filled with banks, expensive shops, and immense manor houses. Noblemen and women live in Hillside, and patrolling guards make sure that it stays that way. Beggars are not tolerated, thieves are nigh on nonexistent, and shop owners fear to barter with their customers, lest they are important.  Kvothe makes his way to this side of Tarbean to beg, and earns one whole silver penny from a young woman..  He is then confronted by a guard, beaten in an alley, and left for dead in a snowbank.  As he begins to regain consciousness, he sees two demons standing infront of him, one seemingly called Holly.  The other one is Encanis, the Lord of Demons.  He wants to take Kvothe with him, but cannot as they are being pursued by a horde of people.',

      'The University is a place of higher learning, specializing in many different fields of study. The University is situated approximately two miles west of Imre, separated from the city by the Omethi River which can be crossed by the Stonebridge. The University is comprised of fifteen different buildings which house the disciplines taught within. It is surrounded by a small town that caters to the needs of the students. The University is a well-respected institution throughout the Four Corners, and the only place where one may earn a guilder and be recognized as a true arcanist. The University stands out due to its instruction in disciplines that closely resemble magic, replacing technological development with Sympathy, Artificery, Alchemy and Naming. When Kvothe attended the University, it contained somewhere under 1500 students, who generally came from wealthy families.',

It is stocked with a wider variety of potables - coffee and chocolate - than might be expected for such a remote village, and experiences a loyal following of regulars from the townsfolk. It was purchased or built by the current owner Kote, who runs the inn with the help of his apprentice, Bast. The inn has a large main room, filled with tables and containing the bar. There is a great stone fireplace in this room. The inn also has a cellar where various things, apples, meat and such, are kept cold. There are rooms upstairs for the inn's guests along with Kote and Bast's own rooms. Outside the inn has stables for the horses of merchants who sporadically come through to Newarre.",
